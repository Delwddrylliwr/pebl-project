  * Can learn with observational and interventional data
  * Handles missing values and hidden variables using exact and heuristic methods
  * Provides several learning algorithms; makes creating new ones simple
  * Has facilities for transparent parallel execution using several cluster/grid resources
  * Calculates edge marginals and consensus networks
  * Presents results in a variety of formats

[Pebl Documentation](http://packages.python.org/pebl/) includes installation instructions, tutorial and API reference.

Pebl has been developed at the Systems Biology Lab at the University of Michigan and is available with a [permissive MIT-style license](http://pebl-project.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/LICENSE.txt).
